# Backend – Parking Prediction API

## Install dependencies

**From the `backend` directory**, install with the same Python you'll use to run the server:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This installs packages for `python3`, so `python3 run_server.py` will find them.

## Run the server

From the `backend` directory:

```bash
python3 run_server.py
```

(If `python` works on your system, you can use `python run_server.py` instead.)
